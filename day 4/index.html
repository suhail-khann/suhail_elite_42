                    <p>DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric block cipher that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key. The encryption process involves 16 rounds of permutation and substitution based on the Feistel structure.

                        DES Encryption Steps:
                        Initial Permutation: The 64-bit plaintext is permuted using a fixed table.
                        Feistel Rounds: The 64-bit block is split into two halves, and 16 rounds of Feistel functions are applied.
                        Final Permutation: After 16 rounds, a final permutation is applied to produce the ciphertext.</p>
